# Lab 1.1: MakeCode Arcade scavenger hunt

## Introduction
A sprite is an object that has behaviors and properties, including an image. Sprites are the main components in MakeCode Arcade and many other programming environments. Usually, a sprite will represent the main character of a project in MakeCode Arcade, and the player will control that sprite in some way. Sprites also represent enemies, objects to collect, or obstacles.
Sprites have many properties, or pieces of information that make a sprite unique from other sprites in the game. You already have learned some of these properties. In this unit, you will revisit those properties, and you will learn about new sprite properties.

### Part 1: Blocks scavenger hunt
This activity is a scavenger hunt. Some of the blocks below will be familiar to you from previous labs; others may be new.
Create a new project called Scavenger Hunt. For each of the blocks below, find the block in the toolbox. Identify the drawer where you found the block. (Hint: Guess the drawer’s name based on the description in the block. If you are able, use the colors as a guide.) Then, place the block in the on start container that is already on your workspace. Within the on start block, place the blocks below in the order that they are presented.
After you have placed the block within the on start block, watch the simulator and try to discover what the block does. How does it affect the sprite? If the block has things that you can change, try different values and see how the sprite responds. Each block below has a list of things to try. Be sure to try each of the items listed, but feel free to explore on your own, too!

Toolbox drawer:
Purpose:
Be sure to add an image. Feel free to use one from the gallery for now.

Toolbox drawer:
Purpose:
You already are familiar with the coordinate system used in MakeCode Arcade. Try some different numbers as a reminder.
Are there any numbers that are not allowed for x or y?

Toolbox drawer:
Purpose:
Which buttons are used to control the sprite?

Select the expand button (the encircled plus sign).
	•	What new properties appear?
	•	What happens when you change the values of vx or vy?
	•	Can you use these values to restrict the player’s movement in some way?
	•	Are there any numbers that are not allowed for vx or vy?

Toolbox drawer:
Purpose:
Click on the expand button.
	•	What new properties appear?
	•	What is the purpose of each of the new properties?


### Part 2: Renaming sprites
Before our next scavenger hunt, let’s learn how to change the name associated with a sprite. Follow the instructions below to change the name of your sprite from mySprite to heroSprite.
	•	Next to any of the red ovals with the name mySprite, click on the down arrow. A menu appears.  
Near the bottom of the menu, select Rename variable….
	•	In the dialog that appears, enter the new name, heroSprite. Then, click on OK or press Enter on your keyboard.  
Notice how all instances of the old name, mySprite, have changed to the new name, heroSprite. Get in the habit of giving meaningful names to your sprites.

### Part 3: Image editor scavenger hunt
Click on the image for your hero sprite to open the image editor. Now, explore each drawing tool in the image editor. Try to identify the following tools:
	•	Canvas size
	•	Circle
	•	Cursor coordinates
	•	Done and save changes
	•	Eraser
	•	Fill (sometimes called bucket)
	•	Flip and rotate
	•	Line
	•	Marquee
	•	Palette and shortcut colors
	•	Pan (sometimes called grab)
	•	Pencil
	•	Pencil size
	•	Rectangle (sometimes called box)
	•	Undo and redo
	•	Zoom
